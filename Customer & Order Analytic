In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1. How many orders were placed in January? (the bottom two lines are to filter out the uncleaned data)

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM jansales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

2.How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM jansales
WHERE product = 'iPhone';

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, Price
FROM Jansales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM Jansales);

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity), product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM febsales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM febsales AS feb
LEFT JOIN customers AS cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
