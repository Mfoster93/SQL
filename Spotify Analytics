# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. What is the average danceability by artist and track? 
SELECT artist_name, danceability
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC;

#2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity 
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3. Determine the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#4. What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, duration_ms
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity, avg(danceability)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity
LIMIT 10;

#6. List top 20 songs with highest enegry
SELECT track_name, energy
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 20;

#7. What artist had the most songs in the Top 50 based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) AS total_songs
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_songs DESC
LIMIT 1;

#8. Which 5 songs and artists were the loudest based on liveness?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, liveness
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY liveness DESC
LIMIT 5;

#9. What is the average duration of Doja Cats songs
SELECT artist_name, AVG(duration_ms) AS Average_duration
FROM spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = "Doja Cat";

#10. What is the most popular song with the fastest tempo
SELECT track_name, popularity AS Most_Popular, tempo
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC, tempo DESC
LIMIT 1;
